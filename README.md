# Sentiment Classification with Transformer Encoder on IMDB Dataset

This project implements a **Transformer Encoder Architecture** using **Keras** to classify movie reviews from the **IMDB dataset** as positive or negative. The model leverages the power of transformer-based attention mechanisms to efficiently process and analyze textual data, delivering robust sentiment classification results.

## Features
- **Dataset**: Preprocessed IMDB reviews with labeled sentiment categories.
- **Architecture**: Transformer Encoder with multi-head attention and positional encoding.
- **Framework**: Implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Performance**: Achieves competitive accuracy with minimal computational overhead.

## Highlights
- Understandable implementation of transformer encoders.
- Modular code for easy customization and experimentation.
- Visualization of attention weights for interpretability.
